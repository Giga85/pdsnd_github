### Project Title
Bike Share System

### Description
In this project, I will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

In this project, I write code to provide the following information:


#### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day


#### 2. Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)


#### 3. Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time


#### 4. User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
